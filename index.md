## Portfolio

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside, advised by Professor Vagelis Hristidis. My research lies at the intersection of Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, with a focus on retrieval and ranking, generative and multimodal question answering, deep learning, and reasoning with large language and vision-language models (LLMs & VLMs).

I have industry experience as an NLP Intern at Samsung Research America, where I worked for three consecutive summers (2023â€“2025) with the Natural Language Understanding team at the Advanced AI Lab. My projects centered on orchestration workflows for LLM-powered voice assistant solutions.

I received my M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from UC Riverside in December 2024, and my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in March 2019.
